#  Lab 8: Software Development Security 

*If you run any of the code provided in the example files, you assume all responsibility for the consequences*

## Introduction

One of ITâ€™s strengths is the ability to rapidly assimilate and interpret information from a systems perspective.  As part of your education prior to this course, you have taken classes on programming, web systems, databases and networking.  You will now put all of this to use as you review unfamiliar code as you look for vulnerabilities.

## Learning Objectives

- Analyze unfamiliar code samples to Identify vulnerabilities.
- Determine the impact of various code vulnerabilities.
- Produce remedial recommendations to address code vulnerabilities.

### Teamwork

This is an individual lab.

## Lab Description

### Directives

1. Identify vulnerabilities in the code provided.
2. Mark up the code to identify the vulnerability, explain the risks involved and suggest remedial steps.
   1. Use comments in the following format
   2. Create a best practices poster that explains how to avoid each type of vulnerability you have found.
   3. See snippet below:
```C 
This is vulnerable code  //This is your note about the code.
/* Put block comments after the code to explain more about the vulnerability along with your recommendations on risk mitigation and resolution */
```

### Assumptions

1. example1.cs has 4 or more vulnerabilities.
2. example2.py has 4 or more vulnerabilities.
3. example3.aspx has 1 or more vulnerabilities.
4. example4.java has multiple vulnerabilities.
5. example5.c has 1 or more vulnerability.

### Considerations

- How is each vulnerability caused? 
- What risks may be posed by each vulnerability?
- How can each vulnerability be mitigated?

## Support

### Useful Resources

 - Your own experience
 - A good code editor
 	- Vim
 	- Visual Studio
 	- Sublime Text 3

### Teaching Assistant and Instructor Support

Labs will be covered by a TA or instructor during scheduled hours.  Please check the schedules posted on learningsuite or inside the door of 385 CTB for support availability outside of lab hours.

### Can I do it remotely/on my own equipment?

Indeed you can!

## Grading

### Deliverables

- Commented code.
- Best practices poster.  Be creative!  Your poster should be sufficiently detailed as to explain the type, risk and remedy for vulnerability types.  Your target audience is the development team.

### Rubric

| Grade | Description                                                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 50%   | Discovery of vulnerabilities.  (Points reflect difficulty, not number of vulnerabilities.  For number of vulns, check the assumptions).  *example1.cs :  8 points; example2.py:  15 points; example3.aspx:  6 points; example4.java:  15 points; example5.c:  6 points;* |
| 30%   | Correct risks and remedial steps presented                   |
| 20%   | Best Practices Poster                                        |

### Expectations

- Students are expected to do research to understand the syntax of the code and identify the vulnerabilities.
- Students are expected to present simple steps to avoid/mitigate/reduce the exposure of the vulnerability.
- Students are expected to design an attention grabbing poster.  There may be prizes for best posters
